# Watch Together App

The purpose of the application is to give viewers of a streamer who is watching
content they can't show on stream, a place to watch both. There is a simple bar at
the top to set the embed/youtube link and another to pick the streamer.

The video will play in large on the left and the streamer/twitch chat will be on the
right, with the chat below the streamer.

Honestly, this comes from watching COD matches during events or qualifiers alongside
Zoomaa, and I wanted somewhere I could watch both in a single tab, instead of having
two tabs or two windows to be able to view them both.
